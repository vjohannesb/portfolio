## 📜 Description

A relatively simple portfolio website built in ReactJS, with TypeScript. Initiated with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), and some edits to the TypeScript template. Some elements use Bootstrap for certain design purposes, but most of it is done in SCSS.

## 🔴 Attribution

Please refer to my repo, or my website, if you decide to use any major part of this - I did spend some time on getting everything how I wanted it to be, and some sort of credit would be nice. Other than that, all is free to use however you please!
And with that said, please feel free to report bugs or submit pull requests with improvements. Any and all help is greatly appreciated ☺

## 📦 Extra Packages

1. [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for routing
2. [react-text-loop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-text-loop) for animated text
3. [react-transition-group](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transition-group) for transitioning between views/routes
4. [react-tsparticles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tsparticles) for particle background **_(not implemented yet)_**
5. [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) & [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) for linting and formatting
    1. eslintrc.js & prettierrc.js inspired by [Joe Previte's article](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jsjoeio)) but altered in some ways
    2. Make sure to install the dev-dependencies if you're planning on using this
6. (Bootstrap via CDN as most people most likely have it cached anyway...)

## 🔜 Future iterations

My plan is to update this continously, when I have the time to do so. Ideas for future improvements include:

1. Less reliance on external packages
2. No Bootstrap
3. [Projects](https://jbergendahl.se/projects)-page needs a revamp
4. Minor design changes here and there...
